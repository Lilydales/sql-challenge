# sql-challenge
I'm now sure how the .sql file works. When I open it using the vs code, some of my codes were disappear, so please it will be better if open using text editor.

The 2st part (Data Engineering) was using the export from the QuickDBD, so I keep its own format. The 3rd one was made by myself, so it might look unsual.
